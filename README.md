# The Dummy Data Gen Branch
Welcome to the testing world of our recipe and json files. This branch is only used for data gen and has all the items we add to the mod added as normal minecraft items so they can be used within the data generation system. 

This branch is needed for data generation due to the issues with SWEM's data gen system calling on a sheet that we do not have permissions to view/call. Since we have to call SWEM in our mod as it is a key part of it, we must have it as implimentation and thus when we run our data gen, so is SWEM's... and thus the error with the permissions occurs. 

Thus, we have this branch. A weird little off shoot that allows me to stop making all the json files be hand like I did for the first 300~ items we initally added to the mod before we started work on this branch.

***Please do not use this branch for anything other than reviewing the data generation system as this branch has __NO__ functionality as we intend the mod to run.***
